This is a Visual Studio NUnit Test Project Template. It adds new project type "NUnit Test Project" to Visual C# > Test category. The created project will not have a reference to NUnit assembly. Please use nuget manager to add latest NUnit dll reference. The created project will have just one test class NUnitTestFixture. Use this class as base for your unit tests.
